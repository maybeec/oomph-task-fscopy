= Oomph File System Copy Setup Task

== Purpose
The `oomph-fscopy-task` is an extension for the https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/oomph[Eclipse Oomph Installer] that allows to copy resources (files and folders) from a source on the file system to a target.

== Usage

* Install the task via eclipse https://maybeec.github.io/oomph-task-fscopy/update/[update site]

* `resource` specifies a file or folder to be copied. On linux the implementation tries to follow symbolic links but if no destination is found symbolic links are ignored.
* `destination` specifies the destination folder in which `resource` will be copied into. This must be a folder
